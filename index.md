# Welcome to Arbor

Welcome! 
Arbor (**A**nalysis of **R**easoning **B**ehavior through **O**pen **R**esearch)  is an open collaboration, where people across the internet can work together publicly and in real time, to collectively analyze and interpret AI reasoning models. 
By sharing partial progress and early results, we aim to eliminate duplicative work and dramatically accelerate progress.
To get started, take a look at the list of [project discussions](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/discussions). If you're curious who's involved, see the [People page](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/wiki/People) of the wikiâ€”and please add yourself if you like!

Our goal is to create a clearinghouse where people can:
* Ask, discuss, and prioritize research questions
* Post, discuss, and analyze early and partial experimental results
* Provide a reference for what the research community has learned.
  
Our strategy is to find ways for people of all types of backgrounds to participate.
Our on-going projects can be found in [Discussions](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/discussions).

## Why is interpretability research urgent for reasoning models?

Interpretability research is especially urgent in the case of reasoning models. (By "reasoning model" we mean LLMs that have been trained to exploit extended inference-time computation.) These systems appear to be powerful, yet remain mysterious. Understanding them better can help us create safer technology, sooner. It's also a grand intellectual challenge.

See [Discussions](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/discussions) to participate!


## Why work collectively, in the open?

Open-source reasoning models have appeared relatively recently, and many different groups are looking at them right now for the first time--likely working along similar lines. We think the community can move faster and save work by sharing partial results and early ideas. Although the academic machine learning community already has an admirable culture of sharing preprints of finished work, we think it's worth experimenting with an even more open model.

An important element of our plan is to find ways for people many levels of experience and skill to participate. In a project like this, there will be important roles for experience ML researchers, for people looking to break into ML research with small concrete coding projects, people who want to work on pure theory, who people like analyzing data, etc. In fact, there will may be room for "citizen science" where people with no direct machine learning experience can help find patterns in model outputs and inputs.

Our efforts are inspired by the world of open-source software, and also mathematical initiatives like [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) and [Equational Theories Project](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories).

## How to participate

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details, but here are some starting points:

* We're using github [Discussions](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/discussions) to track active projects. If you want to propose or start a new project, follow feel free to start a new project thread; you can use [this intro](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/discussions/1) as a template.
* Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/SeBdQbRPkA). We are using [NDIF](https://ndif.us/)'s server - once you join, look for channels related to Arbor.
* See who's involved at the [People page](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/wiki/People). Feel free to add your name and your interests!
* If you have finished work, or know of a paper on arxiv people might be interested in, please publicize it on Discord, and add a link to the [Bibliography](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/wiki/Bibliography).
* Please read through our [notes on authorship/credit](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/blob/main/CREDIT.md).


### A note on authorship

Our hope is that this project will catalyze multiple "classic" conference papers and collaborations. We advocate a fair, generous attitude toward authorship; see [CREDIT.md](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/blob/main/CREDIT.md) for more information.



# How to use this repository.

We track projects in the [Discussion](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/discussions) section.
Please browse through this list to get a sense of ongoing work, and find projects you might potentially want to join.

To propose a new project, add a new discussion.
The first post of each thread should follow a strict template, which includes:
- **Research Question** Capturing the main goal of the project
- **Owners** Names(and github usernames) of project leads 
- **Project status** Is this project ongoing? Are you looking for collaborators?
The first post should also be treated as a project-specific "Wiki" that summarizes the current status of the project. Please see [instructions here](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/discussions/1) and [an example here](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/discussions/6).
