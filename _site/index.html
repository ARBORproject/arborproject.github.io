    <h1>ARBOR</h1>
    <h2>Analysis of Reasoning Behavior through Open Research</h2></header>

<p>Welcome! 
Arbor is an initative to organize a radically open, massively collaborative project where people across the internet can work together publicly and in real time, to analyze recent reasoning models, collectively.
By eliminating duplicative work, we hope to dramatically accelerate progress.</p>

<p>Our goal is to create a central clearinghouse where people can (1) ask, discuss, and prioritize research questions, (2) post and discuss full (or even better, early+partial) experimental results, (3) host a Wiki-like repository to self-organize and communicate what we have learned.
The goal is to make this as open as possible, and to find ways to let people of all types of backgrounds participate.</p>

<p>Our efforts are inspired by initiatives like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project" target="_blank">polymath</a> and <a href="https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories" target="_blank">Equational Theories Project</a>.</p>
