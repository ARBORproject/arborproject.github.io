# The Arbor Project

Welcome! 
Arbor (**A**nalysis of **R**easoning **B**ehavior through **O**pen **R**esearch)  is a radically open collaborative project where people across the internet can work together publicly and in real time, to collectively analyze and interpret AI reasoning models. 
By sharing partial progress and early results, we aim to eliminate duplicative work and dramatically accelerate progress.

Our goal is to create a central clearinghouse where people can:
* Ask, discuss, and prioritize research questions
* Post, discuss, and analyze early and partial experimental results
* Serve as a clearinghouse for what the research community has learned.
  
The goal is to make this as open as possible, and to find ways to let people of all types of backgrounds participate.


## Why is interpretability research urgent for reasoning models?

Interpretability research is important in general, but especially urgent in the case of reasoning models. (By "reasoning model," we mean LLMs that have been trained to exploit extended inference-time computation.) These systems appear to be powerful, yet remain mysterious. Understanding them better can help us create safer technology, sooner. It's also a grand intellectual challenge.


## Why work collectively, in the open?

Open-source reasoning models have appeared only recently, and many different groups are looking at them right now for the first time--likely working along similar lines. We think the community can move fast and save work by sharing partial results and early ideas. Although the academic machine learning already has an admirable culture of sharing preprints of finished work, we think it's worth experimenting with a more open model.

An important element of our plan is to find ways for people many levels of experience and skill to participate. In a project like this, there will be important roles for experience ML researchers, for people looking to break into ML research with  small concrete coding projects, people who want to work on pure theory, who people like analyzing data, etc. In fact, there will may be room for "citizen science" where people with no direct machine learning experience can help find patterns in model outputs and inputs.

Our efforts are inspired by the world of open-source software, and also mathematical initiatives like [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) and [Equational Theories Project](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories)

## How to participate

Some starting points:

* Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/SeBdQbRPkA)! We are using NDIF's server - once you join, look for channels related to Arbor.
* Add your name and your interests to the wiki [People page](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/wiki/People)
* If you have an "open problem" or specific question, please add it to the [Research Questions](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/wiki/Research-Questions) list. If you can think of specific experiments that would help resolve the question, please add those too!
* If you're looking for ways to dive in and help, the [Research Questions](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/wiki/Research-Questions) list is a also good place to start! And if there's a specific experiment you plan to execute, please add a note that you're working on it.
* If you have finished work, or know of a paper on arxiv people might be interested in, please publicize it on Discord, and add a link to the [Bibliography](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/wiki/Bibliography).
* The [main wiki page](https://github.com/ArborProject/arborproject.github.io/wiki/) has general links. Please feel free to add to the wiki!


### A note on authorship

An issue that will naturally come up in this type of project is credit, especially authorship on papers. Indeed, our hope is that this project will catalyze multiple "classic" conference papers and collaborations. We may add more formal guidance in the future, but for now we advocate an inclusive attitude toward authorship.

## Discussions

The Discussions section is designed for collaborators to self-organize and collaborate together. Please use the categories as described below:

### General:

This is a place to give meta-level suggestions on how to run our collaboration. Are there processes that are currently not working for you? Is there a better way of tracking results?

Remember, this collaboration is meant for everyone -- feel free to suggest improvements!


### Request for Plots:

This is a place for community members to post "RFPs" -- [Requests for Plots](https://mlcollective.org/rfp/) - inspired by [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/)!

Taken from ML Collective:
"A Request for Plot (RFP) is a method for jump starting a decentralized collaboration by pitching a project starting with a big-picture idea and ending the pitch with a concrete description of the first plot that one would produce to start the project. It is a call for collaborators, and anyone that wishes to work on the project has only to produce the plot to start the collaboration!

An RFP is like a request for research (e.g. from [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/requests-for-research) and from our own [Sebastian Ruder](https://ruder.io/requests-for-research/)). But whereas these requests for research often describe broader directions for inspiration, RFPs further ground it into a concrete first step for implementation and connote an open invitation for collaboration."

### Show and Tell:

This is a place to share your findings, including preliminary or negative results! If easier, please feel free to link to your own blog post/ArXiv links.

## Wiki

The Wiki section is where we will accumulate results to track our progress. The Wiki is editable by anyone! Feel free to contribute.
